# Who we are :wave:

ApexRMS is a team of ecologists :earth_americas:, data scientists :chart_with_upwards_trend:, and software developers :computer: who provide a unique combination of consulting services and software solutions. Our goal is to develop transparent, state-of-the-art models in support of ecological forecasting. We work closely with our clients and other experts to translate their ecological understanding into appropriate models.
