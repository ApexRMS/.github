# Who we are

ApexRMS is a team of ecologists, data scientists, and software developers who provide a unique combination of consulting services and software solutions. Our goal is to develop transparent, state-of-the-art models in support of ecological forecasting. We work closely with our clients and other experts to translate their ecological understanding into appropriate models. Visit our [website](https://www.apexrms.com) to learn more about our tools and services, people, and past projects. 

Underlying all our modeling tools is a free software platform called SyncroSim, which provides a modeling framework for rapidly delivering complex suites of ecological models and data to decision makers. Visit the [SyncroSim website](https://www.syncrosim.com) to learn more.
